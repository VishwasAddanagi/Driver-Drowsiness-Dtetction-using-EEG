# Eye-State-Classification-using-EEG
Developed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for classifying eye states using EEG data.
Implemented advanced techniques such as filtering, batch normalization, and dropout to enhance model performance.
Utilized a fractional activation function to improve the accuracy and robustness of the classification.
